# Market-Regime-Classifier
A project exploring market regime classification methods using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), enhanced by an entropy-gating post-model diagnostic layer to stabilise transitions and reduce noise in low-volatility periods, while minimising regime classification latency.
